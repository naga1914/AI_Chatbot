# AI Chatbot

This is a simple AI chatbot built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replies to your messages with preset responses — nothing fancy, just a clean and easy chat experience in the browser.

## What It Does

- Basic chat interface  
- Replies to user input with simple, hardcoded answers

## Why I Made This

I wanted to create a basic chatbot to learn more about JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It’s a good starting point for anyone interested in building chat apps or learning frontend coding.

## What’s Next

- Add more replies and improve the chat logic  
- Maybe add animations or typing effects  
- Possibly connect with real AI APIs later
